Attempt to install macOS Sonoma on a 12" HP Pro X2 tablet

### Overall
So far the build is awesome, cold boot time to Mac in 16 seconds!

### Specifications
* Processor: Core i5-7Y54 1.2GHz (Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz)
* Graphics: Intel HD615 (Up to 2GB of shared mem) / 1080p 24bit
* RAM: 4GB LPDDR3 1866MHz
* Hard Disk: PCI NVMe 128GB SSD
* Wifi & Bluetooth: Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265

### Bonus
* Wi-Fi & Bluetooth work, but with experimental driver and HeliPort app (expect some problems)
* ICC Profile that improves the screen's native color

### What doesn't work
* Apple TV DRM

### Notes
* Use HeliPort to control Intel Wi-Fi
* Use QuickESP, a StatusBar App to mount EFI partitions with ease
